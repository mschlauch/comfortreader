## DESCRIPTION
Comfort Reader makes reading easier for you.
It streams any text directly to your eyes.
Smart text processing and colored letter animation helps you to recognize and understand text faster and better.
Reading a book will seem just like watching a film - at the speed that works best for you.

Main features:
- supported file formats: txt, pdf, and epub
- displays just the current phrase you are about to read
- makes sure that associated words won't get randomly chopped (as in conventional Speed Reading Apps with Rapid Serial Visual Presentation)
- creates a fluent stream of text at your desired speed
- colored letter animation stimulates better concentration and comprehension
- trains your reading, reduces regression, and expands your vision span
- fully customisable text appearance and reading configuration
